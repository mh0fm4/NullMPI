NullMPI

This is a trivial (and currently incomplete) MPI implementation
for use as a uniprocessor replacement.  Use this to port your
parallel code to machines without a MPI implementation or quick
test-compiles.

Nullmpi allows global communications, but does not implement
point-to-point communications to self.  Timing is supported.
Compilation options allow for debug and statistics output.

Furthermore, the set of headers can be used with the static
source code checker splint (see <http://splint.org/>) for
portability testing.

For installation, please read the file INSTALL.
The newest available version can be obtained at
<http://wissrech.ins.uni-bonn.de/research/projects/nullmpi/>.
Please direct feedback to <wildenhues@ins.uni-bonn.de>.
