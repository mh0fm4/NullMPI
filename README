nullmpi

This is a trivial (and currently incomplete) MPI implementation
for use as a uniprocessor replacement.  Use this to port your
parallel code to machines without a MPI implementation or quick
test-compiles.

Nullmpi allows global communications, but does not implement
point-to-point communications to self.  Timing is supported.
Compilation options allow for debug and statistics output.

Furthermore, the set of headers can be used with splint[1] for
portability testing.

For installation, please read the file INSTALL.
